The Odin Project, Project #2: CSS landing page

This repo is part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. I will be touching on CSS here mainly and creating a landing page.

The purpose of this project is to put into practice the CSS learning contents and creating a 
webpage that hopefully looks good on different browsers and devices.
